# Pomodoro Clock

In this project, the goal was to create a pomodoro timer in which 25-minute sessions of productivity are executed with 5-minute breaks.

The skills that I used for this particular project include:

* Creating an HTML template with a future design in mind, avoiding having to refactor most of it

* Writing a simple CSS reset to have finer control over the web page design

* Utilizing browser developer tools to aid in page design

* Use vanilla JavaScript to write logic, as opposed to relying on shorthand code offered by jQuery

* Write self-descriptive variables to make code to improve code clarity

* Separate functions by functionality to avoid clumping everything together

* Test for edge cases to minimize bugs/errors

* Test website using developer tools to account for different screen sizes, including mobile devices
